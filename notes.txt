// originally, the only way to submit some form data to a server was through the <form> tag in HTML.
// It can do a POST or GET request.
// With JSON you can now grab the contents of the <input> in a form and submit those with JSON instead of as form data.
    // JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
    // JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
    // JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
        // JSON.parse() -- pass the JSON as the parameter and it will return an object
            var obj = JSON.parse('{"name":"John", "age":"30", "city":"New York"}')
        // JSON.stringify() -- pass an object as the parameter and it will return as JSON
            var myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj)
// You can now submit to the server whenever you want without it necessarily being a <form>, through AJAX.
    // For a single page app:
    // Event occurs on a webpage (such as logging in)
    // XML HTTP Request object is created using JavaScript
    // Sends a request to the web server
    // Server processes the request
    // Server sends the response back to the webpage
    // Response is read by JavaScript
    // User is able to log in!
